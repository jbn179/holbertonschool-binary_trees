* binary_tree_height - Measures the height of a binary tree.

* Return: The height of the tree. If the tree is NULL, return 0.

* Description: The height of a node is the length of the longest path
* from that node to a leaf. A leaf node has a height of 0, and each
* other nodeâ€™s height is one plus the maximum height of its left and
* right children.
